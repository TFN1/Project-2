For my project 2: Outside the grid I decided to redesign the Canberra based; Performance Edge Physio website. My process included research into the business, design of the site, development of the desktop site and then making it responsive.

The design is relatively simple, I just wanted to simplify and strengthen the existing site's content.

This was the first time I have used a static site generator to develop a website and found it an interesting challenge beyond ‘normal’ coding. Understandably, I can see the benefits of this style as a site gets bigger however at first I found it more complicated to split the content and code into these different sections.

I managed to get some work flow going between the layout and markdown files through headings, paragraphs and links. The biggest challenge I found was trying to create multiple pages and linking these up through the file structure; something to look into as I'm sure I was just missing something simple.

Despite this challenge I believe this project shows a basic understanding and execution of a responsive website using a front-end framework.
